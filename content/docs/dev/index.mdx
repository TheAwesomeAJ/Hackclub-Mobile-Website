## Quickstart
### Run convex dev command to set up locally or cloud
```
pnpm dlx convex dev
```

### Generate a better auth secret
```
pnpm convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

### Setup client id and secret
Get a client ID and secret from [Hack Club](https://auth.hackclub.com/developer/apps)

The redirect URL should be `https://xxxxx-xxxxx-xxx.convex.site/api/auth/oauth2/callback/hackclub`, replacing `xxxxx-xxxxx-xxx` with your convex site URL.

```
pnpm dlx convex env set HACKCLUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
pnpm dlx convex env set HACKCLUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```
(tip: use `$(read)` so it doesn't get saved in your shell history)
