## Code of Conduct

This project follows our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful and report any unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

---

## I Have a Question

Check the README and existing issues first. If you still need help, open an issue and include: OS, Node/Expo versions, platform (iOS/Android/web), and reproduction steps or logs.

---

## I Want To Contribute

By contributing you confirm you have the rights to submit the work and agree to the project license. Create focused PRs and open issues for discussion first when appropriate.

---

## Reporting Bugs

Before filing, update to the latest app version and search existing issues. A good bug report includes: expected vs actual behavior, steps to reproduce, platform, versions, and screenshots/logs. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly — contact maintainers privately.

---

## Suggesting Enhancements

Search existing suggestions first. For new ideas, open an issue with a clear title, the current behavior, the proposed improvement, and a brief rationale or mockup if available.

---

## Providing Feedback

Open an issue labeled as feedback and describe UX notes, confusing flows, or general impressions. Be specific and constructive.

---

## Your First Code Contribution

Start with `good first issue` labels, ask questions on the issue, and keep changes small. For PRs: create a branch, target `main`, and describe what and why. Reference any issue the PR fixes so GitHub can close it on merge.

---

## Improving The Documentation

Doc contributions welcome: fix typos, clarify language, add examples, or update outdated instructions.

---

## Styleguides

Follow the project’s coding and commit conventions. Keep commits clear and focused.

### Commit Messages

- Keep messages short and descriptive.
- Explain the intent, not just the change.

---

## Join The Project Team

If you want to stay involved: contribute regularly, help others, and participate in discussions. Maintain a positive, collaborative approach.
