# Tech Stack

Hack Club Mobile is split into two main parts: the mobile app and the website. Each part has its own stack, chosen to keep the project simple to develop, deploy, and contribute to.

---

## 📱 Mobile App

The mobile app runs on both iOS and Android and is written entirely in TypeScript.

### Expo  
Expo is the runtime and tooling layer for the app.

- Handles native APIs (camera, haptics, filesystem, etc.)
- Provides local development with hot reload
- Manages builds for iOS and Android
- Eliminates the need to manually configure Xcode or Android Studio

Expo is the foundation that lets the app stay “one codebase, two platforms.”

### React Native  
React Native is used for all UI and app logic.

- Component-based UI
- Standard React patterns (hooks, state, context)
- Shared code across platforms
- Typed with TypeScript

All screens, navigation, and interactions live here.

### Convex  
Convex is the backend platform.

- Database
- Server-side functions
- Real-time subscriptions
- Automatic syncing between clients

There is no separate API server to maintain. The app calls Convex functions directly, and data updates propagate in real time.

Typical uses:
- User data
- Projects and apps
- Syncing state across devices
- Background logic (validation, permissions, etc.)

### Better Auth  
Better Auth handles authentication and identity.

- User accounts
- Sessions
- Sign-in / sign-up flows
- Integration with Convex

It keeps auth logic out of the app code and centralizes it in one place.

## 🌐 Website

The website hosts documentation, project info, and community-facing pages.

### Next.js  
Primary web framework.

- Routing and layouts
- Server-side rendering
- Static generation for docs
- Deployment-friendly

### Tailwind CSS  
Used for all styling.

- Utility-first CSS
- Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- No separate CSS files to manage

### shadcn/ui  
Component system built on Tailwind.

- Buttons, inputs, dialogs, cards, etc.
- Accessible by default
- Components live in the repo and are editable

### Prose UI  
Used for long-form content.

- Documentation pages
- Guides and articles
- Consistent typography and spacing for text-heavy pages

This stack keeps both sides of the project:

- Fully TypeScript
- Low in infrastructure overhead
- Easy to run locally
- Straightforward for new contributors to understand
